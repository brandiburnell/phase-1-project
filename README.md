# Colorado Brewery Finder

Colorado Brewery Finder is a Single Page Application (SPA) that operates as the name suggests - it locates breweries by city, zipcode, or brewery type within the state of Colorado. 

## How It Works

Colorado Brewery Finder takes three possible user inputs (city, zipcode, and brewery type). Once the user search criteria has been gathered, the SPA will fetch Colorado Brewery Data from the Open Brewery DB API. The API data will then be filtered by the user input, and any breweries matching their criteria will be displayed.

## Installation

Fork and clone a copy of the repository  
Open the index.html file in your browser  
You are good to go!  

## Usage
The user is able to enter up to three types of search criteria. To search by city, enter a city in the first text box. Zipcodes can be entered in the second box, and brewery type can be selected with the dropdown. 

Once search criteria has been entered, press submit to find breweries.

To see details of a specific brewery, move cursor over the title of the brewery.

The user may narrow the search result by entering more search criteria once inital results have loaded.

The "I've already been here!" button will remove a brewery from the list to narrow down the user's choice to breweries they have not visited yet.

Once the details are displayed, a user can visit the website of their chosen brewery by clicking the link with the text "WEBSITE."
